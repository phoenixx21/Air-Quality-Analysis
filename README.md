The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize the data of Air Quality in India.

India has made it to the headlines when it comes to air pollution. The growing air pollution in the country has been one of the serious concerns for both the government and the citizens.Here perform Exploratort data analysis and Visualization on dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following features :

1. stn_code : Station code. A code given to each station that made the measurements.

2. sampling_date : The date when the data was recorded.

3. state : It represents the states whose air quality data is measured.

4. location : It represents the city whose air quality data is measured.

5. agency : Name of the agency that measured the data.

6. type : The type of area where the measurement was made.

7. so2 : The amount of Sulphur Dioxide measured.

8. no2 : The amount of Nitrogen Dioxide measured.

9. rspm : Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter measured.

10. spm : Suspended Particulate Matter measured.

11. location_monitoring_station : It indicates the location of the monitoring area.

12. pm2_5 : It represents the value of particulate matter measured.

13. date : It represents the date of recording (It is cleaner version of 'sampling_date' feature)
